# Forty

Another SPA Framework written in TypeScript.

Currently creating this as a hobby project, but we'll see where it goes.

### Get it running

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run `npm run serve` or `yarn run serve`
4. Webpack should start a development server on port 9000
